# Status Reports Folder
Weekly/bi-weekly status reports go into this folder. Status reports were only used for the Fall Semester since the GitHub commit history serves as documentation for progress made during the Winter and Spring. Much of the work in the Fall semester involved meetings and discussing ideas, so status reports were necessary for that.
