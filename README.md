# CS-21-303-SMV-Honey-Bee-Dance-Language-Translator
## Science Museum of Virginia
## Honey bees use a “waggle dance” to provide directions to their colony about where to find flowers for pollen. We’d like an app that interprets the distance away from the Museum’s colony that the bees are “waggle dancing” about. 
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others that will 
follow in your foot steps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| Documentation |  Folder including the abstract, final poster, installation guide, and project storyboard |
| Notes and Research | a large amount of our notes and research have been informal documents on Google Drive. The files in this folder are formalized, condensed versions of these notes |
| Status Reports | these are status reports for each week of the project. These reports include our accomplishments for the week, a summary of meetings, and our current goals. Status reports were only used in the fall semester since the Github commit history shows the project status for the spring |
| scr | Source code - contains three subfolders: Bee-AI-Modules for the backend processing, DB for saving processed data, and UI Modules for the front end |
